# imgopen

A desktop GUI app that opens folders of images and allows you to sort them into "keep" and "delete."
Motivated by my the massive piles of images that I take on my phone and camera that I can't seem to get rid of.

# setup
1. Clone the repository (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/hungale/imgopen.git`)
2. Go into the folder `imgopen`
3. Make a venv and start.
4. Install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). Note that this  
   project runs on Python3.
5. Start the program with `python main.py`.
6. Select a folder of images when prompted.
7. You should be able to see the images in the selected folder now.  
   - Move them to a folder called `keep` by clicking "Keep,"
    or to a folder called `delete` by clicking "Delete."  
   You can click "Reload" to select a different folder.
